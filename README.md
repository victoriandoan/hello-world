Getting started

Hello everyone!

I'm Victoria, and I'm really interested in getting started programming! I've been learning Python from the following sites:
  * Codecademy
  * Codecombat
  
I hope to learn more, test my skills in Codingame, and actually creating my own programs. Someday I want to program fun things like video games. I've already compiled a list of all the things I want to try making. Here's a few items from my list:
  * Calculator
  * Number-Guessing Game
  * Text adventure
  
More about me:
I'm pretty shy and not too fond of talking to people on the phone. However, I can chat it up if it's online via text. I like plushies, tacos, burritos, and deep fried foods.

Hobbies:
  * Cooking/baking
  * Playing video games
  * Crocheting
  * Knitting
  * Origami
  
Favorite animals:
  * Anything fluffy and cuddle-able
  * Corgis
  * Kitties
